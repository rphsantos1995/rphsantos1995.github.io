<p id="idn1">I was amazed for code since the first time i could 
    manage to <b>copy and paste</b> some VBA scripts from stackOverflow.
    I can't tell excetly what i felt when realized i could stop
    doing some manual job for good, first time i heard of automation.
    I can tell this makes my life easier, and i just need a how to search on 
    google, theres no such thing like special gifts, you just have to make your hands dirty,
    that is right! You gotta make tons of mistakes in order to learn and improve, its all about
    that learn and improve.
